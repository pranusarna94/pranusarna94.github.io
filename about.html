		<p class="about-body">Hello,</p>

		<p class="about-body">
			My journey in to product design started in my 3rd year of computer science engineering while building a project for school. Then is when I realised building software is more than just code and how it can solve real world problems for real people. I developed interest in the effect software has on people and eventually taught myself digital product design.

		<p class="about-body">
			Soon, I joined <a class="banner-link" href="">Pyoopil</a> (later acquhired by <a class="banner-link" href="">UpGrad</a>) as a front-end developer. Pyoopil was an early stage start-up  trying to solve the problem of collaboration of teachers and students in the digital sphere. Not being happy with their app designs I proposed a redesign with some mocks. The founders decided to incorporte the design in to their app.

			Currently I am at Zomato and have worked on a wide variety of products including the principle business of search and discovery. I currently work with the two fastest growing products of the company - <a href="https://www.zomato.com/blog/3-million-orders-in-a-month" class="banner-link">Zomato Order</a> & <a href="https://www.zomato.com/blog/the-making-of-gold" class="banner-link">Zomato Gold</a>.

		<p class="about-body">When not at work I like reading Graphic novels. My recent favorite is <a href="" class="banner-link"> The Best We Could Do.</a>
