		<p class="about-body">
			I am a product designer, currently at <a class="banner-link" href="">Zomato</a> in New Delhi, India where I have worked on the principle business of search and discovery of restaurants along with the other popular products such as Zomato Order & Zomato Gold. Previously, I interned with <a href="">Roposo</a> and <a href="">Pyoopil</a> which was later acquihired by <a href="">UpGrad</a>.

		<p class="about-body">I like to read graphic novels and have a problem with people who laugh them off as comics. My recent favorite is <a href="" class="banner-link"> The Best We Could Do.</a>
