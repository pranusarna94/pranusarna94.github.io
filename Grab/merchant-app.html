		<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">To understand the restaurant operations I visited 3 restaurants in my city during lunch time and was fortunate enough to witness these restaurants at their peak order volume. Being a fly on the wall for these restaurants taught me a pattern in which restaurants generally work in and I believe this pattern is more or less the same throughout the world.

		<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
			Through my visits to these restaurants, I also tried to understand the users for this app. Here is what I observed. Constantly increasing new orders, customers calling to know the status of or to make changes to their orders, back and forth with the kitchen to pass the new orders or check up on the old ones, keeping a track of the delivery executives, managing inventory. Their job was chaotic and tough!

		<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">On understanding the managers and the circumstances they operate in, I was in a better position to define the goals for the app. Here they go:</p>

		<ol class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
			<li class="body-text-bold col-lg-10 offset-1">The app should give clear visibility of in-kitchen orders, incoming new orders and past orders. It should also let the manager action upon these orders.</li>

			<li class="body-text-bold col-lg-10 offset-1">The app should ensure that the major task of searching and identifying an order is easy and quick.
			</li>

		</ol>

		<p class="heading-2 col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 ">The solution</p>
		<p class="heading-3 col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">In kitchen orders</p>

		<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Orders which are currently being prepared are housed in the first tab of the app. This is done as in kitchen orders require more attention and immediate actioning. </p>

		<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">The new orders button is a gloabl level element which means it can draw over other apps. This button is designed to draw attention of the users but at the same time not distract them from a task which they might already be performing on the phone. This is done by momentarily ringing the phone (to draw attention if user is away from phone) and by making the button flash by inverting its colour (to draw attention when the user is using the phone). </p>

		<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"> On accepting an order, the manager is presented with a pop-up in which they can change the preparation time for the order.

		<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"> Once the order is accepted, it is appended at the bottom of the list and the view window is scrolled to that order. This is done to make sure that the restaurant manager adds this order to their POS and passes it on to the kitchen. The managers can quicly view the order details which further aids in the process of adding the order to the POS. </p>

			Since managers are busy people every second of their time is valuable. Searching and identifaction of an order was important for the managers to communicate about it with their kitchen, the Grab rider and Grab support. This was done by showing the orders which matter the most upfront. 
		</p>

		<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"> 
			The restaurant managers communicate with their kitchen about an order using the order items. Hence, to aid this communication between the managers and the kitchen it was important to surface the items on the order card.

			Learnings
		</p>
		<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"> 
			This experience of crafting an app for restaurant managers made me realise how important and tough their job is. Also, indulging in even a little bit of user research makes the final design better by miles as that makes you empathise with the users and helps understand their problem better. If I had a little more time on my hands I would have loved to understand the usability issues with the app by doing some scenario based guirella user testing. Prototyping the animations for the "New Order" and "Order dispatched" flows would have come second.
