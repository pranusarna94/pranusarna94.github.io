		<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">As we grew the ordering food online business to 300 thousand orders a day, it was also important to bring our customer retention to speed. Zomato Treats was launched to make ordering food on Zomato a delightful experience and it was hypothesised that this would in-turn increase customer loyalty.</p>

		<p class="heading-2 col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">What is it?</p>

		<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
			Zomato Treats is a subscription service charged at Rs. 250/year through which members get a free Treat with every order placed online. The free Treat can be a drink or a dessert depending on the restaurant partners. Me and <a class="body-link" href="http://aiswaryakolisetty.com/">Aiswarya</a> designed this experience.

			<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">The restaurants get an increase in the number of orders and get to expand their business. An increase in repeat orders would also mean growing customer loyalty.</p>

		<p class="heading-2 col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Talking to the customers</p>

		<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
			We talked to about 15 people in our office building and told them about the new product. Most of them seemed pretty excited about it, but had some doubts like:
		</p>

		<ul class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
			<li class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-1">Can I chose the dessert/drink of my choice?</li>
			<li class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-1">How much would be the actual cost of this free Treat?</li>
			<li class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-1">On days when I donâ€™t feel like having the dessert, can I opt out of it?</li>
		</ul>


		<p class="heading-2 col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">What we wanted to achieve</p>

		<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
			Since Treats was a new product, the best way to understand the problems that could arise with it was to release it in the wild. To grow our member set quickly we decided to design the flow to maximise for purchases.
		</p>

		<p class="heading-3 col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Buying Treats should be a Treat</p>

		<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
			At first we just had one purchase flow in mind. A nice juicy banner on our homepage as the entry point to our Treats page explaining the membership in detail.
		</p>

		<p class="image-caption text-center col-lg-6 offset-lg-3 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Buying Treats through the homepage banner</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="container">

		<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
			However, we soon realised that this flow alone might not be the best in maximizing Treats purchases. Customers making orders on Zomato would be more inclined on purchasing the membership, once they realised that they could receive a free dessert or a drink with their order as well.This made us add us add the Treats subscription to the menu and the cart as well.

		<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
			Adding the Treats purchase flow to the menu and the cart, gave rise to a lot of edge cases. This gave us the opportunity to think like developers and map out all cases before the mocks go to the devs.

		<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
			To share this logic of addition and removal of items from cart we represented the flows as pseudo-code for the devs. It was a proud moment when they complimented us on thinking through the flow completely and told us how significantly it decreased their dev time.

		<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
			We have been able to sell 60,000 Treats membership since its launch in August 2017.
		</p>

		<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
			To find out if Treats was actually a delightful experience for our customers, we looked at the difference in number of orders a Treats member made before and after becoming a member. It was encouraging to see a significant increase. A month after the launch, data told us that a Treats user was more likely to turn into a sticky user (customers who place at least one order per month) when compared to a non Treats member. Great Success!

		<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
			I and Aiswarya were developing the product from scratch and thus delved into a branding exercise for this project as well. We made mood boards and developed some ideas before Charu helped us develop the beautiful pink theme.
