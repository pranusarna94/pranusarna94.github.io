			<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">When I joined Zomato in July 2016, one of my first projects was to redesign of the mobile-web with Gui Corte Real. To give the best experience of browsing Zomato on a mobile browser we decided to transform the m-web in to a Progressive Web App. Since the redesign was expansive, it was imperative for us to collaborate closely and be on the same page at all times.</p>

			<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">We both had prior experience of development and had a fair understanding of working with Git. Therefore, we decided to use GitHub to collaborate and keep a track of our sketch files.</p>

			<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">If you are new to Git and don’t understand the fundamentals, here is a quick tutorial.</p>

			<p class="body-text-bold col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Why not use Google Drive or Dropbox?</p>
			<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Where’s the fun in not doing something new? We were fascinated by the idea of version control system for designers and this project gave us the best opportunity to test out if Git could be of any help for design teams.</p>






			<p class="heading-2 col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">This is what we wanted to achieve</p>

		</div>	

		<div class="container" >

			<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">The experience of setting up our repository with the empty sketch files was a breeze. However, as we kept committing our changes, problems started to sprout.</p>


			<p class="heading-2 col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Putting Git to the test
			</p>

			<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Git for the most part worked like intended. But soon we realised that comparing two versions of Sketch files was not possible with GitHub. This was because Sketch files were not code and would be treated as binary files.</p>

			<p class="image-caption text-center col-lg-6 offset-lg-3 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">WOAH!! Is that the matrix?</p>
		</div>

		<div class="container">

			<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Trying to push changes to the same file on GitHub would result in…CONFLICTS! Sketch being treated as a binary file meant we could not resolve these conflicts as well. Conflicts resulted in us losing some progress as well.</p>

			<img class="img-responsive no-padding col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12" src="git_conflicts.gif">
			<p class="image-caption text-center col-lg-6 offset-lg-3 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Learning not to work on the same file, the hard way</p>
		</div>


		<div class="container">
			<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Files above the size of 100 mb are common in design but not so much in code. As we kept on progressing, the sketch files grew and so did the time to push the changes and this slowed us down as a team.</p>

			<p class="heading-2 col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Final verdict
			</p>

			<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">By trying out Git for design collaboration we understood its shortcomings and how it was not well suited for designers.</p>

			<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Tools like Abstract and Plant are specifically built as design version control systems. Both tools solve this problem in their own way and have their pros and cons. Plant has a snappy sketch plugin and web app and is more suited for beginners while Abstract felt like an app created for people who are already used to Git and its concepts.</p>

			<p class="body-text col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">If you guys used Git for design or any of these tools, do share your experience!</p>

			<p class="body-text-bold col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Cheers!</p>
